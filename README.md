## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later)
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
* A **Gemini API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Local Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/parimalingle1805/ai-code-documentation-generator.git](https://github.com/parimalingle1805/ai-code-documentation-generator.git)
    # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd ai-code-documentation-generator
    ```
2.  **Create the Root Environment File:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. This is used by Docker Compose.
    ```env
    # /.env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
3.  **Create the Backend Environment File:**
    Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory. This is used for running the backend locally without Docker.
    ```env
    # /backend/.env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
4.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    The simplest way to run the entire application stack is with Docker Compose.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
5.  **Access the Application:**
    * The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
    * The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5001`

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Pipeline

This project is configured for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

* **Trigger:** Every push to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow located in `.github/workflows/`.
* **Process:** The workflow builds new, optimized Docker images for the frontend and backend services.
* **Publish:** Upon a successful build, the images are pushed and tagged on Docker Hub.
* **Deploy:** The hosting provider, [Render](https://render.com/), is configured to watch for new images on Docker Hub and automatically deploys the latest version, ensuring the live application is always up-to-date.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation for future enhancements, including:
* [ ] Implementing a `localStorage`-based history panel to view past generations.
* [ ] Adding a language selector dropdown to improve syntax highlighting accuracy.
* [ ] Architecting and building a full user authentication system with JWTs and a MongoDB database to provide persistent, user-specific history.
